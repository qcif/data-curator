Feature: Open a Comma separated value file
  As a Data Packager
  I want to open a comma separated value (CSV) file
  So that I can describe, validate and package the data

  RULES
  =====

  - The Open Comma Separated command can be invoked using the menu or a keyboard shortcut
  - The data will be stored in a ".csv" file
  - The most common form of separated value files is a comma separated value (CSV) file. The [CSV Dialect specification](http://frictionlessdata.io/specs/csv-dialect/#specification) describes variations that use Tab or Semicolon to seperate values. Custom formats are sometimes used. Each of these formats can be described using a CSV Dialect that describes the 'delimiter' and other options.
  - Use the default CSV dialect values in the specification to open the file and separate the values into the correct columns.

  LATER
  =====

  - "Guess Column Properties" on opening the file

  @impl
  Scenario: Open a file
    Given Data Curator is open
    When the "File"->"Open"->"Comma separated..." menu is selected
    Then the openfile dialog should be displayed

  @impl
  Scenario: Open an existing comma separated value file
    Given Data Curator is open
    When the "csv" file "valid.csv" is selected in the openfile dialog
    Then a new tab with the title "valid" should be displayed
    And the table rows and columns should match the "csv" file
    # And set the CSV Dialect in the Table Properties to "Comma Separated"
    # And "Fix Ragged Rows"
    # And "Freeze Header Row"
