Feature: Find data
  As a User
  I want to find data within the current column or across the current table
  So that I can determine if the data exists and correct it if necessary

  RULES
  =====

  - Users can choose a search constraint to find data across the table or within the current column
  - The default search constraint is find in column
  - When "Find next" is invoked but no values are found on reaching the end of the column/table, start the search from the top of the table
  - When "Find previous" is invoked but no values are found on reaching the top of the column/table, start the search from the bottom of the table
  - "Find" can be invoked using a toolbar, menu item, toolbar, or keyboard shortcut
  - "Find next" and "Find previous" can be invoked using a using a menu item, button or keyboard shortcut
  - "Find next" and "Find previous" can only be invoked after a search value has been entered
  - The warning that the replace command cannot be undone should say, "Warning, the replace command cannot be undone. Save your work before making changes"

  LATER
  =====

  - The column that cursor is in should be displayed in the search panel
  - The table that is active should be displayed in the search panel
  - The search order is down columns and then across rows
  - Find in Table

  Scenario Outline: Basic Find
    Given Data Curator is open
    When "<name>" is invoked using the "<type>": "<sequence>"
    Then the "Find and Replace" panel should be displayed
    And a prompt for a "find" value should be displayed
    And a prompt for a "replace" value should be displayed
    And the "Find and Replace" panel's first input should have focus
    And the column that the cursor is in should be displayed
    Examples:
      | name | type                       | sequence   |
      | Find | toolbar menu button        | Find       |
